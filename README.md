# BME3053-Diabetes-Analysis
Our teams Final Project for the 2024 Spring Semester of BME3053C aims to identify and visualize trends in the diabetes diagnoses in the geographical regions of the United States using socioeconomic data from two years of interest.

Part One: 
Part one of our project takes the large dataset and calculates the correlation coefficients for each factor that determines Social Vulnerability Index and plots these against the general data for Diabetes Diagnoses. 
From there, we determined our identifying factor to be Socioeconomic status (SES) to which we performed further data analysis one that one factor in part 2.

Part 2:
With our factor, SES, we took the data from every county in the U.S. and separated them into their respective states using the FIPS county codes, placed the states into groupings based on the four geographical regions of the U.S. and plotted SES percentile against Diabetes Diagnoses from the years 2010 & 2018.
Final observations were drawn from these graphs to identify trends.

Part 3 (FinalProjectPredict)
Using general diabetes diagnoses data from the CDC in the past 20 years, we plotted the next 20 years based on a derived trendline to predict the concerning increase in diabetes that will come in the future.
